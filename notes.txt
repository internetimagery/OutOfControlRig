# Notes:

# Check provided meshes for skin clusters
# Get skin weights from clusters and pair them to joints
# Cache vertexes for colouring later.

# Track selection change to switch to our context tool
# return colour back to normal if context clicks on something other than model
# get point on surface clicked
# associate it with a joints
# select joint and colour mesh

# Generate IK chains dynamically by following the limb back to its base.
# Look for more than one child, this is the root.
# Check vectors for each bone and check for parallelism. If parallel
# treat the bones as twist joints with regards to IK

# Have a dockable GUI that changes colour if tool is active or not.
# Track meshes that are active.
# Button to do rarer things such as Pinning IK chains

# Implement "pinning" of IK limbs. This would retain the IK handle
# and keep it stuck in place. A new object "pin" would be created

# if selection lands on an end joint that doesn't affect anything really,
# Jump back a joint in the chain. UNLESS the chain is a single joint chain
